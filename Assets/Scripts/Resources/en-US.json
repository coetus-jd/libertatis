        "I remember our captain obsessed with treasure, that wouldn't be a problem, but we constantly faced death because of this obsession.",
        "We came to Brazil because there was evidence that the captain's treasure was here, i expected to find Roque Brasiliano, a brazilian pirate, but i didn't find it.",
        "Your idiot Roque Brasiliano is Dutch, he just spent a lot of time here in Brazil ... and apparently we will also pass",
        "Our captain said that the treasure will be divided precisely  between us, not least because the pirate code says it, but it  is fair to lose half the crew as a result.",
        "Bloody English corsair drinker of tea, we've lost a lot of our  own, we've lost a lot of things, and we're nowhere near the treasure.",
        "We fell but they fell too but the corsair continues, how is that possible?",
        "It's cold, it's dark, but it looks calm, am I alive?",
        "There are many slaves in Brazil, I even saw a ship full of men, women, children and the elderly, some of whom seem to have been thrown overboard.",
        "We want the treasure, but is it all worth it, if you offered a slave the treasure in exchange for your life or offer him his freedom, but he would be poor having enough to survive, just, what would he choose."
