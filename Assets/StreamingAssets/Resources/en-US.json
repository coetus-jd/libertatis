            "We came to Brazil because there was evidence that the captain's treasure was here,  expected to find Roque Brasiliano, a brazilian pirate, but i didn't find him.",
            "Your idiot Roque Brasiliano is Dutch, he just spent a lot of time here in Brazil ... and apparently we will also pass",
            "Our captain said that the treasure will be divided precisely  between us, not least because the pirate code says it, but it  is fair to lose half the crew as a result.",
            "Bloody English corsair drinker of tea, we've lost a lot of our  own, we've lost a lot of things, and we're nowhere near the treasure.",
            "We fell but they fell too but the corsair continues, how is that possible?",
            "It's cold, it's dark, but it looks calm, am I alive?",
            "There are many slaves in Brazil, I even saw a ship full of men, women, children and the elderly, some of whom seem to have been thrown overboard.",
            "We want all that treasure, but will it worth it? Guess now, if you have offered a slave all that treasure in exchange for his life and freedom, what would he choose? Wealth or liberty? Such a dilemma...",
            "Find the eight pieces immediately, i need all of them, find them so we can get out of this damn place.",

            "We finally found all the pieces, but..."
